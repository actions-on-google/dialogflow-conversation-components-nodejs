# Actions on Google: Dialogflow Conversation Components Sample

*:warning: Warning: Conversational Actions will be deprecated on June 13, 2023. For more information, see [Conversational Actions Sunset](https://goo.gle/ca-sunset).*


A sample featuring rich responses for building Actions on the Google Assistant while using the [Node.js client library](https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs) and deployed on [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/).

:warning: This code sample was built using Dialogflow. We now recommend using [Actions Builder or the Actions SDK](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/overview) to develop, test, and deploy Conversational Actions.

## Setup

Select **only one** of the options below.

### Option 1: Add to Dialogflow
To create agent from our template:

[![Conversation Component](https://storage.googleapis.com/dialogflow-oneclick/deploy.svg "Conversation Component")](https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/oneclick?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fdialogflow-oneclick%2Frich-response-agent.zip&agentName=ActionsOnGoogleRichResponsesSample)

### Option 2: Dialogflow Restore and Firebase CLI

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and NPM
    + We recommend installing using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
1. Install the [Firebase CLI](https://developers.google.com/assistant/actions/dialogflow/deploy-fulfillment)
    + We recommend using version 6.5.0, `npm install -g firebase-tools@6.5.0`
    + Run `firebase login` with your Google account

### Configuration
#### Actions Console
1. From the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), New project (this will be your *Project ID*) > **Create Project** > under **More options** > **Conversational**
1. From the top menu under **Develop** > **Actions** (left nav) > **Add your first action** > **BUILD** (this will bring you to the Dialogflow console) > Select language and time zone > **CREATE**.
1. In the Dialogflow console, go to **Settings** ⚙ > **Export and Import** > **Restore from zip** using the `agent.zip` in this sample's directory.

#### Firebase Deployment
1. On your local machine, in the `functions` directory, run `npm install`
1. Run `firebase deploy --project {PROJECT_ID}` to deploy the function
    + To find your **Project ID**: In [Dialogflow console](https://console.dialogflow.com/) under **Settings** ⚙ > **General** tab > **Project ID**.

#### Dialogflow Console
1. Return to the [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com) > select **Fulfillment** > **Enable** Webhook > Set **URL** to the **Function URL** that was returned after the deploy command > **SAVE**.
    ```
    Function URL (dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment): https://<REGION>-<PROJECT_ID>.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment
    ```
1. From the left navigation menu, click **Integrations** > **Integration Settings** under Google Assistant > Enable **Auto-preview changes** >  **Test** to open the Actions on Google simulator then say or type `Talk to my test app`.

### Testing this Sample
+ (Recommended) Open up the Assistant app then say or type `OK Google, talk to my test app` on a mobile device where Google Assistant is associated with the same account as your Action.
+ You can also use the Actions on Google Console simulator to test most features and preview on-device behavior.
